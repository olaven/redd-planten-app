## Keep the plants watered! 
Made for my girlfriend, to help her remember to water a plant in her room. Based on an arduino project built at the "Redd Plantene Med Programmering"-event (https://github.com/9khil/reddplantene)

## Todo 💻 ☕️
- [x] Sketch out GUI 
- [X] Refactor/Remake whole thing -> ugly and messy code atm
- [ ] Enable alerts when getting dry (I need apple dev license for this..)
- [X] Color changing based on plant status

## How to run this 
* Install React Native and its dependencies by following [this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) guide👍
* run ```react-native run-ios```

📓 
iOS is the platform I have in mind. As of now, building for android _should_ work as well ☎️
