## Keep the plants watered! 
Made for my girlfriend, to help her remember to water a plant in her room. Based on an arduino project built at the "Redd Plantene Med Programmering"-event (https://github.com/9khil/reddplantene)

## Todo 💻 ☕️
- [x] Sketch out GUI 
- [X] Refactor/Remake whole thing -> ugly and messy code atm
- [ ] Enable alerts when getting dry 
- [ ] Color changing based on plant status

## Current (unfinished) look
